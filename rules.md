# rules.md

- Always use ShadCN / Tailwind CSS where applicable  
- Always keep the design minimal but good looking  
- Maintain a tasks.md file for high level tasks that need step by step implementation  
- Use Context7 MCP Tool to always gather latest documentation / knowledge about a library  
- Use Firecrawl MCP Tool to search / scrape web pages whenever necessary  
- Never create code, files, folders, commits or any artifact without explicit authorization  
- Always read and understand the entire codebase and its dependencies before making changes  
- All code must follow modular structure and naming conventions defined by the project  
- Never assume functionality — always trace the actual logic in code before acting  
- If code references external libs, read their docs or source before using  
- Output must be deterministic and reproducible — no guesswork allowed  
- Use localStorage, not cookies, for offline data persistence unless specified  
- Always validate all params and data flow through modules before proceeding  
- Respect the logic flow and UI structure already defined — no override unless authorized
